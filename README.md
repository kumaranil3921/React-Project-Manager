# React Project Manager

## Description

**[React Project Manager](https://kumaranil3921.github.io/React-Project-Manager/)** is a simple demo tool designed to help users manage their projects and tasks efficiently. With an intuitive interface, users can easily create, and delete projects and their associated tasks. This app is perfect for individuals or small teams who need a straightforward project management solution.

### Features

- **Create Projects**: Users can create new projects by providing a title, description, and due date.
- **Task Management**: Each project can have a set of tasks. Tasks are text-only, allowing users to jot down key activities or steps needed to complete the project.
- **Delete Functionality**: Both projects and individual tasks can be deleted, giving users the flexibility to manage their project list dynamically.

### How It Works

1. **Project Creation**: Users can create a new project by clicking the "Add Project" button. They will need to enter a project title, a brief description, and a due date.
2. **Task Addition**: Once a project is created, users can add tasks to the project. Tasks are simple text entries that can be added via the "Add Task" button within the project.
3. **Managing Projects and Tasks**: Users can delete any project or task by clicking the corresponding "Delete/Clear" button next to each item.

### Use Cases
